I'm giving you the list of bugs I found in the wizard here, in order to be more structured about them.


## Region/Discipline Page

1. "Mostrar años anteriores" should not bounce you back to the start of the page.
    > It's still weird. I'd just like to keep the scroll position.


## Contribute

1. Right now, if Cloudfare Turnstile doesn't pass, I'm still allowed to click on Submit.
    > Not sure if this is still hapening.

2. Redirection after magic link is not working: I'm stuck on the contribution form, with no overlay, and never getting back to the event page.
    > It still doesn't work: I'm stuck on the contribution form.

3. Contribution after magic link is not working: data is not saved to the DB.
