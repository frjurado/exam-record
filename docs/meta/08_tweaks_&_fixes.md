Some thins to improve & fix in the project after phase 7.2.


## Infrastructure
- Set domain to wikianalisis.org.
- Magic link from any email address?
- Two machines on Fly.io? (load is too slow)
- Change the DB to PostgreSQL? (necesary if more than one machine)

## UI improvements
- Group links under "Andalucía" to avoid text clutter.
- Discipline page: event boxes could show status badge/work if validated.

## Features
- Consider opening more disciplines for the exam record (that implies reorganizing the structure).

## Text revision
- Index page: revise text.
- Discipline page: revise text ("Obras verificadas"?).
- Event page: title = "Piano - 2025"; subtitle = "Andalucía"
- Event page: revise text & the flagging badge.
- Event page: "IMSLP" button could be next to title & bigger.
- Contribute form & modals: revise text.
- Add a small "About" note at the bottom of index page.

## Bugs & issues
- Revise wizard_buglist.md and fix the most important issues.
